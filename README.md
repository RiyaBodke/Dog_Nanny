# Dog_Nanny
Every dog owner's dream-come-true! 

A website for dog daycare. Dog Nanny is a startup idea of a pet centre that will take care of pet dogs. Some people live alone, work during the day, travel to other cities and are not willing to keep their dogs alone at home. Dog Nanny takes care of their dogs in such situations. They also provide many other services like haircut, grooming and vet-checkups. Dog nanny also has paid sessions for dog owners regarding pet training and taking care of pets.
